## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Java JDK 8 or higher
- Git (optional, for cloning)

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ali-Amir-code/Java-Snake-Game.git
   cd Java-Snake-Game
   ```

2. **Compile the code:**

   ```bash
   javac src/*.java
   ```

3. **Run the game:**

## How to Play

- **Start the game:** Launch the program as described above.
- **Control the snake:** Use the arrow keys (`↑`, `↓`, `←`, `→`) to change the direction of the snake.
- **Eat food:** Move the snake to eat the food. Each time the snake eats, it grows longer and your score increases.
- **Avoid crashing:** Don’t let the snake crash into the walls or itself, or it's game over!
- **Restart:** After a game over, you can restart the game by pressing the appropriate button (if implemented).
